# Music Collection
# You have been asked to create an app that will allow a music collector to manage their collection of CDs/records.
#
# In their console they would like to be able to:
#
# Create and Save Artists
#
# Create and Save Albums
#
# List All Artists/Albums
#
# List all the albums they have by an artist
#
# Show the artist any album belongs to
#
# Every artist should have a name, and each album should have a name/title, genre and artist ID.
#
# Further tasks
# Additionally it would be nice to be able to:
#
# Edit Artists/Albums
# Delete Artists/Albums
# Find Artists/Albums by their ID
# Remember to regularly git commit!
